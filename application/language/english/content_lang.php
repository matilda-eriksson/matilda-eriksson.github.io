                            I specialise in translations from Swedish to English and from English to Swedish.
                            I've worked on a wide variety of texts for a diverse range of clients, across a broad
                            range of industries. As an accredited journalist myself I have a particularly keen
                            interest in the media sector and have several years experience working on media and
                            website translations.
                            </p> 

                            <p> 
                            As well as translation I offer a range of analytical services, including copy-editing,
                            proofreading and corporate media analysis, all available in both languages. Sometimes
                            a client may request a combination of these services, so for example proofreading in
                            Swedish followed by a translation to English. I am regularly analysing online media
                            for internationally renowned brands, and so am highly familiar with technical and
                            commercial translation too.

                            <p> 
                            Translators work in different ways. You can rest assured I will always strive keep my
                            copy true to your original text, without compromising on style and fluency. You can
                            expect first-class translations. Projects are delivered on time and to budget and my
                            rates are competitive. All my clients can rely on absolute confidentiality.
